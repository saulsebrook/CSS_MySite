    A block element goes the entire width of the page -- you can change the size
    An inline element is only as wide as it needs to be -- you cannot change the size of an inline element

    To be able to sit elements beside a block element you change the display property
    display: inline; -- will change to an inline element from block - size still cant be changed
    display: inline-block -- changes element to inline element but size can be changed
    display: none; dont show element at all
